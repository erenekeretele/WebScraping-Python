# Price Monitoring and Email Notification System
This project allows you to monitor the price of a product on Amazon and receive email notifications when the price drops below a specified threshold. It logs the price of the product every hour into a CSV file (PRICE.csv) and sends an email alert when the price is lower than the target price.

## Features

1. Price Monitoring:

Automatically checks the price of a product at regular intervals (hourly).

Logs product prices along with timestamps into a CSV file (PRICE.csv).

2. Email Alerts:

Sends an email alert when the price falls below a specified threshold.

3. Graphical Visualization:

Visualizes the price history from the CSV file as a time-series graph using Matplotlib.
